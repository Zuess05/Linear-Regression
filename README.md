1. The first model is a Linear Regression model which is used to predict the scores of a student given the number of hours he/she studies.<br/>
   The data contains a single feature which is the number of hours studied by a student. As the data is simple and contains only one feature, Linear Regression is the optimal algorithm and upon completion it was found that the model obtained an accuracy of 96%.
